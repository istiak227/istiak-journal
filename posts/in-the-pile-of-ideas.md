This is a cold month for us. At this time of the month we happen to have too much ideas on our plate. So many things to learn or develop or to execute. How do you motivate youself to pursue one idea at a time or just jump in with all of em. That's a thing I'm learning. Now working with a small SaaS application for now. Just into Saas for so long. Let's see how far we can go. 


PS: I have five SaaS ideas piled up next, but first start with the easiest one.
