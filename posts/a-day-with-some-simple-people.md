On 26th November, 2021, Me and Mahruz an undergrad friend went to attend a wedding in Kanarampur, Mymensingh, Bangladesh. The journey was not a pleasant one, not there was much time for us to sightsee. We were there for only 20 hours. The things from the journey I took was the simplicity, happiness, and a wedding feast from a deeply rooted urban family. 

Here's to some novice photos
